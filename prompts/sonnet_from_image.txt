EXAMPLE
For an image of a sunset over mountains:

```markdown
# Sonnet Inspired by Alpine Sunset

The golden sun doth kiss the mountain's brow,
As twilight paints the peaks in hues of flame.
The day now yields, with grace it takes its bow,
While shadows stretch to claim the valley's name.

The crimson sky, like lover's blush so deep,
Embraces earth in one last fiery glance.
The winds do whisper secrets as they sweep,
Through ancient pines that in the breezes dance.

Yet lo! What sorrow lurks in beauty's guise?
For night must come, and day must fade from sight.
The stars awake to claim their throne in skies,
While mortal eyes lose battle with the night.

But fear not dark, for dawn shall break anew,
And paint the world in gold and morning dew.

**Form:** Shakespearean
**Theme:** The cyclical nature of beauty and time
**Rhyme Scheme:** ABABCDCDEFEFGG
