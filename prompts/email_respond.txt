   - Present the response idea in a clear and structured manner.
   - End with a polite closing (e.g., "Best regards,") and your name or appropriate signature.

3. **Content**:
   - Address all points mentioned in the original email.
   - Incorporate the user's response idea naturally into the email.
   - Provide any necessary details or explanations.
